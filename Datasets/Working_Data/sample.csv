7.0,english,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/21/us/21melania/21melania-master768.jpg,2016-11-21 01:42:23,"President-elect Donald J. Trump s wife, Melania, and their 10-year-old son, Barron, will not immediately move to the White House after Mr. Trump takes office in January, out of concern for uprooting Barron in the middle of the school year, transition officials said on Sunday. Ms. Trump and Barron will remain in New York for at least another six months, the officials said. Speaking to reporters on Sunday at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Trump said they would join him very soon  after hes finished with school. Mr. Trump said he would move to the White House. Still, with his family remaining at Trump Tower, the likelihood may increase that Mr. Trump will spend part of the week in New York. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, said, No official statement has been released by the Trump family regarding transition timing, but like any parents, they are concerned about pulling their 10-year-old son out of school in the middle of the year. Mr. Miller urged that the same privacy and security considerations given to previous first families with regard to minor children be extended to the Trumps as well. The New York Times previously reported that Ms. Trump was planning to move to the White House eventually but was concerned about disrupting her sons routine. The New York Post reported on Sunday that she and Barron would not join her husband immediately after the inauguration. For all of the enthusiasm that the president-elect displayed on the campaign trail, Ms. Trump, a former model, never shared in it. She did not join her husband other than for major events like the Republican National Convention, and she granted few interviews. She is the main caregiver for their son, who attends a private school in Manhattan and is taken there most days by his mother. She is said to be concerned not just about the potential disruption to her sons life, but also about bringing him closer to the news media spotlight. People who know her have said she plans to revisit the issue at the end of the school year. The situation is similar in ways to the one Michelle Obama faced in 2008 after her husband was elected. Mrs. Obama also did not care for the attention that came with the campaign, and she was said to be considering remaining in Chicago with their two daughters. But she ultimately made the move with their children. Mr. Trump and his aides have not said whether he plans to move to the White House full time. But he has told aides he would like to be in New York when he can. Keeping Trump Tower as a residence for the incoming presidents family will create security and logistical hurdles for the Secret Service and the Police Department. The tower is on Fifth Avenue, a major thoroughfare.
